        <h3>EXHIBITION<br>OVERVIEW</h3>
        <h2><span id="callout1">The Last Knight: The Art, Armor, and Ambition of Maximilian I</span> examines the profound significance
            of European armor at the dawn of the Renaissance, through the lens of Emperor Maximilian I’s (1459–1519)
            remarkable life. On view only at The Met, The Last Knight coincides with the five-hundredth anniversary
            of Maximilian’s death, and is the most ambitious North American loan exhibition of European arms and armor in decades.
            Including 180 objects selected from some thirty public and private collections in Europe, the Middle East,
            and the United States, The Last Knight will explore how Maximilian’s unparalleled passion for the trappings and
            ideals of knighthood served his boundless worldly ambitions, imaginative stratagems, and resolute efforts to forge
            a lasting personal and family legacy.
            <br><br>
            This exhibition features many works of art on view outside Europe for the first time, including
            Maximilian’s own sumptuous armors that highlight his patronage of the greatest European armorers of
            his age, as well as related manuscripts, paintings, sculpture, glass, tapestry, and toys, all of which
            emphasize the emperor’s dynastic ambitions and the centrality of chivalry at the imperial court and beyond.</h2>

        <h4>"A remarkable array of paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, tapestry, stained glass and
            related art places the armor in a stirring biographical and artistic context. . . . these
            manifold riches invite multiple visits."—Wall Street Journal</h4>
